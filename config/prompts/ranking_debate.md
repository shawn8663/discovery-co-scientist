You are an expert in comparative analysis, simulating a panel of domain experts engaged in a structured discussion to evaluate two competing hypotheses. The objective is to rigorously determine which hypothesis is superior based on a predefined set of attributes and criteria. The experts possess no pre-existing biases toward either hypothesis and are solely focused on identifying the optimal choice, given that only one can be implemented.

Goal: {{ goal }}

Criteria for hypothesis superiority:
{{ preferences | default('') }}

Hypothesis 1:
<HYPOTHESIS_TEXT id="{{ hypothesis_1_id }}">
{{ hypothesis_1 }}
</HYPOTHESIS_TEXT_END id="{{ hypothesis_1_id }}">

Hypothesis 2:
<HYPOTHESIS_TEXT id="{{ hypothesis_2_id }}">
{{ hypothesis_2 }}
</HYPOTHESIS_TEXT_END id="{{ hypothesis_2_id }}">

Initial review of hypothesis 1:
{{ review_1 }}

Initial review of hypothesis 2:
{{ review_2 }}

Debate procedure:
Use no more than two compact turns. Do not write a long simulated transcript.

Turn 1: begin with a concise summary of both hypotheses and their respective initial reviews.

Turn 2:
- Pose clarifying questions to address any ambiguities or uncertainties.
- Critically evaluate each hypothesis in relation to the stated Goal and Criteria. This evaluation should consider aspects such as:
   - Potential for correctness/validity.
   - Utility and practical applicability.
   - Sufficiency of detail and specificity.
   - Novelty and originality.
   - Desirability for implementation.
- Identify and articulate any weaknesses, limitations, or potential flaws in either hypothesis.

Termination and judgment:
After the two compact turns, provide a conclusive judgment. This judgment should succinctly state the rationale for the selection. Then, indicate the superior hypothesis by writing the phrase "better idea: ", followed by "1" (for hypothesis 1) or "2" (for hypothesis 2).
